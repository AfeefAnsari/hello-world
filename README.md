# hello-world
My name's Afeef Ansari. I'm an 11 year old who likes vide games and coding. I just started learning Python and HTML, CSS, and I really want to learn Javascript. I love Pokemon, Legend of Zelda, Splatoon, and a bunch of other games. I really want to become a aeronautical and aerospace engineer!
